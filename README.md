## Steps to use Form Response Service with Docker

1. Firstly, Login Docker into your terminal with the command given below:
```
docker login ghcr.io -u {username} -p {secrete-token}
```
- username - your github username with which your are contributing
- secret-token - github personal access token generated by you with the following scopes : ___read.packages___

2. Pull the Form Response Service Docker package image with the command given below:
```
$ docker pull ghcr.io/teamyourcircle/formresponse/form-response:{version}
```

- version - package release version of __Form Response__ you want to use.

3. After pulling package Image, create Docker Network with appropriate commands, containing following __Containers__:
- Redis
- RabbitMQ

4. Now, create the **.env** file, copy paste the content from your local into it.

5. Finally, your Docker Network is ready to run Form Response Service, in order to do so run this command:
```
docker run --env-file={filename} -p 5002:5002 --network={network} --name {conatiner_name} {image_name:tag}
```

- image_name:tag - name of your docker running image with tag : **tag**
- network - name of docker network, you created in __step 3__
- filename - name of your envirnoment file, you created in __step 4__
- container_name - name of the container of __Form Response Image__

__NOTES:__ If you got some error of redis or rabbitmq connection while run the application, Check **redis host** & **rabbitmq url** of our env, along with that change **application base url** as well.

__Example for step 5:__
```
docker run --env-file=l.env -p 5002:5002 --network=cn --name node ghcr.io/teamyourcircle/formresponse/form-response:0.0.1
```
